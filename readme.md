#Single Page Applications with Angular

This is the code from a talk on Single Page Applications with Angular. The talk is available on youtue, and the slides are here: http://www.slideshare.net/FilipBruunBechLarsen/dk-spa-med-angular

The code is kind of english, but the talk+slides are all Danish. 

##Dummy API's
The dummy APIs are implemented naively in PHP (forgive me).
